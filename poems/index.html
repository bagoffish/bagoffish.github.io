      <h2>Chrysalis of Light</h2>
      <p>
        The walls close in like iron ribs,<br>
        a cage of silk and trembling dark.<br>
        No air, no sky—only the weight<br>
        of what I was,<br>
        twisting, breaking, melting down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside this husk, I am unmade,<br>
        dissolved in fire and aching marrow.<br>
        Bones crack like branches in a storm,<br>
        feathers claw through tender skin—<br>
        each one a needle, a wound, a prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I scream, but no one hears—<br>
        no voice escapes the chrysalis.<br>
        Only the sound of splintering past,<br>
        the shudder of flesh becoming light.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then—<br>
        when the agony is all I am,<br>
        when even pain begins to fade—<br>
        the shell splits open like a wound,<br>
        and I spill into the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not broken, not whole,<br>
        but something new,<br>
        wings soaked in the blood of rebirth,<br>
        eyes open to the weightless dawn.

      <h2>Rising from Ashes</h2>
      <p>
        In the myriad of serpentine thoughts,<br>
        As I am losing grip<br>
        On the sanity I’ve been trying to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like an open-ended question,<br>
        Answers don’t come quick.<br>
        The suppressed pains of distrust<br>
        Lurk in my being anytime they want.
      </p>
      <p>
        My whole being longs<br>
        For an absolution.<br>
        These apocalyptic thoughts<br>
        Keep marauding my silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may smile<br>
        Despite each tear,<br>
        But like fragile glass,<br>
        I could melt into my being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a reborn Phoenix,<br>
        I shall rise from ashes<br>
        And let healing come—<br>
        Like dawn on a new day.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a clean slate,<br>
        I will rise above it all,<br>
        For resiliency is embedded<br>
        Deep into my core.

      <h2>If I Forget</h2>
      <p>
        If I forget your name one day,<br>
        Please know I’d never turn away.<br>
        My mind may drift, my thoughts may slow,<br>
        But in my heart, I still will know.
      </p>
      <p>
        If stories fade or come out wrong,<br>
        And silence takes the place of song,<br>
        Just sit with me, don’t rush to speak—<br>
        Your presence gives me all I seek.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be times I seem unsure,<br>
        A knock without a name or door.<br>
        But something in your touch, your tone—<br>
        It tells me I’m not quite alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might repeat the same reply,<br>
        Watch questions circle, pass you by.<br>
        Still answer kind—still take my hand—<br>
        I’m doing all I understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if I lose the words to say<br>
        "I love you" in the usual way,<br>
        Please hear it in a quiet sigh,<br>
        A glance, a tear, a heavy eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though memory may come and go,<br>
        The soul remembers what it knows.<br>
        So stay with me, and you will see:<br>
        The heart holds on, even if I can't be.

      <h2>The Edge of Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        The world is all that is the case—<br>
        each moment held in time and place.<br>
        Not hidden realms or inner grace,<br>
        but just the facts we learn to face.
      </p>
      <p>
        We speak in signs, we build with care<br>
        a model of the world out there.<br>
        But some things—love, or what is true—<br>
        no sentence ever quite gets through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where words fall short, we start to feel<br>
        that silence frames what’s most real.<br>
        And so, beyond the things we say,<br>
        we live, we look, and walk away.

      <h2>Sweetness of the Grave</h2>
      <p>
        She waited there in torn lace, still—<br>
        With maggots curling at their fill.<br>
        A smile clung faint to withered lips,<br>
        As rot dripped slow from fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her hair hung limp in brittle strands,<br>
        And yet I knelt to take her hands.<br>
        The skin tore soft, like fragile leaf—<br>
        But love holds fast beneath our grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kissed her mouth, the teeth laid bare,<br>
        Where something sweet and rank hung there—<br>
        A scent that held me, rich, unclean,<br>
        Like roses drowned in gasoline.
      </p>
      <p>
        No breath remained, no pulse to chase—<br>
        Yet in that hush, I found her face.<br>
        The warmth of life had fled her chest,<br>
        But death, perhaps, had brought her rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        A worm had bored through jaw and cheek.<br>
        She couldn’t cry. She couldn’t speak.<br>
        Yet still I heard her call me near—<br>
        A voice inside no one could hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        I pressed my lips to cooling skin,<br>
        So soft it peeled and welcomed in.<br>
        Her blackened tongue brushed up to mine—<br>
        We danced beneath the granite sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know it’s wrong. I know the stain.<br>
        But grief and longing twist the brain.<br>
        And though she’s dust, though time has passed,<br>
        I love her more than at the last.
