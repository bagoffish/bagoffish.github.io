My name is Coy (Or Bag of Fish). 
I won't list anything majorly personal here; I believe you should learn from me. 
If that deters you, walk along, as I'll probably find something about you that is obnoxious.

Due to past experiences online, I tend to be abrasive and make assumptions about others, 
mainly because I notice traits I dislike. Just talk to me as you would in real life, and we're fine.

I'm a beginner artist, guitarist & composer. I'm deeply into philosophy; I'm an optimistic nihilist & antinatalist. 
My favorite philosophers are Emil Cioran & Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

I'm a multifandom geek; throw a few buzzwords or questions, and I'll know what you're talking about. 
Just skip the hypermasculine nonsense like martial arts manwhas or seinen aura hype.

I like feminine terms, but still call me "he." 
i.e. "Ms/Queen/whateverthehell Coy wow, he's so badass" â€” jokingly. Don't do it unironically.

I'm a minor but fine with adults interacting if you're not a creep.
That's all for now; just talk to me if interested. If normal, 0 biting.
