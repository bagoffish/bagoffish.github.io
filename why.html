I've decided to commit suicide in a few months.

For the first time in my life, I feel that everything is coming together.

That I have the will to change what I can, the grace to accept what I cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference.

The key piece of that being that life is unbearable to me and that despite years of trying, I can find no way to fix it which appears viable in the long term.

I have a few things I want to get done, fairly simple for the most part, and one of them happens to require a few more months of being alive, 
so rather than trying to get my affairs in order ASAP to more quickly end the pain, 
or obsessing over whether I'm letting myself get sucked into obsessive projects of indefinite scope in an unconscious attempt to avoid my end, 
I'm just relaxing and doing whatever things seem comfortably achievable within the arbitrary deadline.

It's not much to do, really. There's a few odds and ends like having visiting a therapist, maybe trying some different meds, though nothing really leaps out at me as significant.

The three major things I want to do are
1. to make all my data public to some people; text files, pictures, videos, music, chat logs, everything
2. to provide a halfway decent overview of it all for anyone who's interested
and finally 3. to write out my will / suicide note

I think #2 is going to account for by far the bulk of my remaining time, as I've accumulated an enormous quantity of stuff I want to pass on and it's intricately and insanely woven through an even more enormous quantity of irrelevant and confusing bullshit.

I doubt I could completely pull the signal from the noise and organize it into a clear and comprehensible work if I had all the time in the world.

Nonetheless, I want to at least try to provide the broad strokes of a map, to pass once more through all the grand vistas and halls of my memory and point out things of major interest that might otherwise have remained unseen.
