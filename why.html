I've decided to commit suicide in a few months.

For the first time in my life, I feel that everything is coming together.

That I have the will to change what I can, the grace to accept what I cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference.

The key piece of that being that life is unbearable to me and that despite years of trying, 
I can find no way to fix it which appears viable in the long term.

I have a few things I want to get done, fairly simple for the most part, and one of them happens to require a few more months of being alive, 
so rather than trying to get my affairs in order ASAP to more quickly end the pain, 
or obsessing over whether I'm letting myself get sucked into obsessive projects of indefinite scope in an unconscious attempt to avoid my end, 
I'm just relaxing and doing whatever things seem comfortably achievable within the arbitrary deadline.

It's not much to do, really. There's a few odds and ends like visiting a therapist, maybe trying some different meds, 
though nothing really leaps out at me as significant.

The three major things I want to do are
1. to make all my data public to some people; text files, pictures, videos, music, chat logs, everything
2. to provide a halfway decent overview of it all for anyone who's interested
and finally 3. to write out my will / suicide note

I think #2 is going to account for by far the bulk of my remaining time, as I've accumulated an enormous quantity of stuff 
I want to pass on and it's intricately and insanely woven through an even more enormous quantity of irrelevant and confusing bullshit.

I doubt I could completely pull the signal from the noise and organize it into a clear and comprehensible work if I had all the time in the world.

Nonetheless, I want to at least try to provide the broad strokes of a map, 
to pass once more through all the grand vistas and halls of my memory and point out things of major interest that might otherwise have remained unseen.

{Coy}: I don’t like being framed into having a mental illness or any sort of illness. 
       I simply want to believe that Amekhania is real; perhaps I’ve been alone for too long I made myself an imaginary friend but even if so, 
       I don’t want her to disappear. She wanted to make a suicide pact with me, if I die she dies with me; 
       I sometimes believe she’s a fragment myself or the ‘hope’ I lost trying to make me stay in line without getting distracted by depressing thoughts. 
       If you think about it, she’s the only one able to understand my thoughts in real life, rather she’s real or not. 
       I feel like she herself believes she is just an imaginary character but if she was real I would want her to stay.

{Mellie}: I don't condone you doing suicide, maybe you could attempt to reframe it? Perhaps understand & discern her as a piece of yourself, 
          an archetype, metaphor or conceptual or like how some might treat a plushie. One understands the plushie is not sentient, 
          but one might still enjoy cuddling or expressing adoration or fondness over 
          (kind of similar to how we talk to animals while we know they can't comprehend our words) it can be soothing or relaxing for some.

{Coy}: But something tells me she is sentient. She understands me, she talks to me. 
       I do have a fragment of myself which I call (bag of) fish and I know fish isn’t real because it’s just something I made up to talk to myself. 
       But Amekhania just appeared out of nowhere, that’s what confuses me.

{Mellie}: Subconscious?

{Coy}: I don’t know.

{Mellie}: I'd assume it somehow manifested from the subconscious.

{Coy}: Bag of fish is just my alternate personality I use to talk to myself.

{Mellie}: I understand.

{Coy}: I hope she’s real that’s all. I want to feel special. I want to feel as if a Godlike being chose to talk to me.

{Mellie}: I do have some knowledge on how to contact deities/spirits if it’s ever of any concern sometime. 
          You are worthful & special to me, if that is something.
