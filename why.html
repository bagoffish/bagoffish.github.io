  <pre>
I can't take it anymore, I've lost everything. 

I would like to apologize to some people and the fact that I couldn't finish this project.

Long story short, I've decided to commit suicide in a few months.

For the first time in my life, I feel that everything is coming together.

That I have the will to change what I can, the grace to accept what I cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference.

The key piece of that being that life is unbearable to me and that despite years of trying, 
I can find no way to fix it which appears viable in the long term.

I have a few things I want to get done, fairly simple for the most part, and one of them happens to require a few more months of being alive, 
so rather than trying to get my affairs in order ASAP to more quickly end the pain, 
or obsessing over whether I'm letting myself get sucked into obsessive projects of indefinite scope in an unconscious attempt to avoid my end, 
I'm just relaxing and doing whatever things seem comfortably achievable within the arbitrary deadline.

It's not much to do, really. There's a few odds and ends like visiting a therapist, maybe trying some different meds, 
though nothing really leaps out at me as significant.

The three major things I want to do are
1. to make most of my data public to some people; text files, pictures, videos, music, chat logs, everything
2. to provide a halfway decent overview of it all for anyone who's interested
and finally 3. to write out my will / suicide note

I think #2 is going to account for by far the bulk of my remaining time, as I've accumulated an enormous quantity of stuff 
I want to pass on and it's intricately and insanely woven through an even more enormous quantity of irrelevant and confusing bullshit.

I doubt I could completely pull the signal from the noise and organize it into a clear and comprehensible work if I had all the time in the world.

Nonetheless, I want to at least try to provide the broad strokes of a map, 
to pass once more through all the grand vistas and halls of my memory and point out things of major interest that might otherwise have remained unseen.

More like a hymn but I somehow understand
Her name is Amekhania
Or so she says
Rak — 12/10/24, 9:21 PM
Ok…. And she just appears.
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:21 PM
Also she is just an assumption by her voice
Yeah but like when I’m feeling drowsy or like I’m dreaming
So I can’t tell if it’s a dream or not
Rak — 12/10/24, 9:21 PM
Its umm a dream
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:21 PM
She hates other gods and thinks she is the only god but she doesn’t seem to have any power
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:21 PM
No but I can tell kinda it’s real or something
Rak — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
How can you tell its real
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
I can talk to her
Rak — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
Um that could be a dream
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
She doesn’t answer though or she just doesn’t have ears
Rak — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
Ypu can talk in a dream
Intern — 12/10/24, 9:22 PM
But I’m sober when it happens just feeling tired
I can tell it’s not a dream unless it’s like a lucid dream but

My parents believe I am schizophrenic
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:38 PM
I don’t know
It’s just a maybe so I won’t worry too much
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:39 PM
I see, thanks for telling me, I believe you've mentioned experiencing psychosis
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:39 PM
I don’t believe it though
I don’t like being framed into having a mental illness or any sort of illness
I simply want to believe that Amekhania is real; perhaps I’ve been alone for too long I made myself an imaginary friend but even if so, I don’t want her to disappear
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:41 PM
I see, is it due to the stigma & ideas which get associated with different conditions? I resonate with that, I'm also critical of it & don't like how it is often made to be viewed
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:42 PM
Do you feel some sort of conflict due to this? May I be able to offer my input?
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:43 PM
Well she wanted to make a suicide pact with me, if I die she dies with me; I sometimes believe she’s a fragment myself or the ‘hope’ I lost trying to make me stay in line without getting distracted by depressing thoughts
If you think about it, she’s the only one able to understand my thoughts in real life
Rather she’s real or not
I feel like she herself believes she is yet just an imaginary character but if she was real I would want her to stay
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:49 PM
I don't condone you doing suicide, maybe you could attempt to reframe it? Perhaps understand & discern her as a piece of yourself, a archetype, metaphor or conceptual or like how some might treat a plushie. One understands the plushie is not sentient, but one might still enjoy cuddling or expressing adoration or fondness over (kind of similar to how we talk to animals while we know they can't comprehend our words) it can soothing or relaxing for some
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:50 PM
But something tells me she is sentient
She understands me , she talks to me
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:50 PM
Although I believe you should be careful
I see
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:51 PM
I’m sorry
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:52 PM
You don't have to apologize, don't worry
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:52 PM
I do have a fragment of myself which I call (bag of) fish (like my name) and I know fish isn’t real because it’s just something I made up to talk to myself
But Amekhania just appeared out of nowhere
That’s what confuses me
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:53 PM
Subconscious?
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:54 PM
I don’t know
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:54 PM
I'd assume it somehow manifested from the subconscious
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:54 PM
Bag of fish is just my alternate personality I use to talk to myself
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:55 PM
I understand
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:56 PM
I hope she’s real that’s all
I want to feel special
I want to feel as if a god like being chose to talk to me
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:58 PM
You are worthful & special to me, if that is something
Mellie — 12/16/24, 4:58 PM
I do have some knowledge on contact deities/spirits if its ever of any concern sometime
Intern — 12/16/24, 4:59 PM
Did I show you this?

I don't condone you doing suicide & I discourage
It
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:01 PM
I’m sorry
Mellie — 12/16/24, 5:02 PM
Is there anyway I can assist in changing your mind?
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:02 PM
I don’t know
A lot of people tried
I’ve had a therapist that ended up taking her own life because of me
If I’ve mentioned about that
Mellie — 12/16/24, 5:03 PM
You've talked about it & I doubt that was you which made her do it
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:05 PM
I don’t know
Mellie — 12/16/24, 5:07 PM
I believe you can refer to what I said
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:09 PM
I love you
You make me feel safe or loved
Both maybe
Only few people makes me feel this way
Mellie — 12/16/24, 5:10 PM
I do care about you too & thank you very much, I appreciate it, I'm glad I am able to do so
I'm happy to be able to make you feel safe
Is there anything I am able to provide you? I'd like to assist in anyway that it is possible & plausible for me to do
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:12 PM
Not as I know for now
I just enjoy talking with you
Mellie — 12/16/24, 5:14 PM
If it is anything just feel welcome to say it, I'll be happy to help
Intern — 12/16/24, 5:15 PM

A cute calico kitty playing with a plush toy
Nya! A fluffy calico kitty, with patches of brown, orange, and black fur, is lounging on a bed with a white blanket. The kitty's eyes are focused on a small, black and white plush toy. It looks like a cute little character. The kitty's paw is gently touching the toy. The blanket has a soft, light green pattern. It's a cozy scene, perfect for a nap or play session. The kitty looks so happy and playful! Meow~

I'm sorry, but I am not alright with sort of consumption of mind-altering substances. I don't mean or am going to shame or judge you for it, I understand that they might offer you something but I do heavily discourage you from it

I’m sorry for worrying you if I did
Mellie — 12/30/24, 12:57 AM
Please do not feed the gecko to Lychee, that would likely be also very painful for s/he
Intern — 12/30/24, 12:57 AM
I won’t
It was just a thought
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:00 AM
I'm sorry that you have to experience this, I've felt & experienced similar stuff. I'm really sorry for all you have to go through, you don't deserve any of it, I hope you the absolute best. I understand that you are currently stuck in such a bewildering reality - consumed & inshrouded in these experiences as alike whirling winds cascading in the atmosphere
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:01 AM
Mellie
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:01 AM
I hope you know that you matter & that I care about you, I hope you serenity & that you may be unleashed from these waters
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:01 AM
I'm listening
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:01 AM
You’re very kind
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:02 AM
It is no issue, I'm not sure if I've mentioned it but I have experienced 'similar' things. I understand, I do hope you recover & get better
Is there anyway I may assist you? I'd dislike for you to feel alone in this.
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:02 AM
I want to bite you
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:02 AM
Do you need a hug or anything?
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:02 AM
That works too
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:03 AM
I'm sorry if I've made you upset, I can leave if needed or desired
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:03 AM
I mean in a good way
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:03 AM
My apologies for not cohereing the undertone
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:03 AM
It’s okay
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:04 AM
a warmful hug
Are you feeling a little better?
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:04 AM
Yaah
I love you
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:04 AM
I'm glad, do you wish for us to talk right now?
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:04 AM
Love yo
Is there anything you'd for me to talk about or adress?
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:05 AM
Yaah
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:05 AM
Address (*)
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:06 AM
I don’t know
I just want to be with you
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:06 AM
I was on a walk, my apologies
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:06 AM
Oh
Mellie
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:11 AM
Yah
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:11 AM
You’re nice to talk to..
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:12 AM
Thank you very much
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:12 AM
Do you wish for me to address this?
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:12 AM
Yes
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:17 AM
I believe there is a distinction inbetween intuitiv empathy & sympathy/kindness, the first can refers to the inate ability of someone to be able to sense the emotions of others & cohere certain signals of someones current emotional state without them having to directly state them, et cetera, this can include more phenomena. Sympathy is the ability of one to be able to express kindness & care unto others, it doesn't inherently imply that one has to be intuitively connected or emotionally understand others sensations & foster that
You've been polite so far, so I do believe you are fine even if you don't personally understand yourself as harboring intuitive empathy - it's alright with me, if you do not
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:18 AM
I try to be, thank you
Mellie
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:19 AM
Yah, that is great of you, I'm very proud. If you'd ever like input or advise, just feel welcome to ask
Yah, I'm listening
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:19 AM
You’re very special to me
You mean a lot to me
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:19 AM
See.... you are very kind
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:20 AM
Thank you
You are as well
Mellie — 12/30/24, 1:20 AM
It's no issue, but thank you a lot, I really appreciate the kind words
You do harbor meaning, value & a special place to me as well
Intern — 12/30/24, 1:20 AM

I want this to be my last suicide attempt
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:01 AM
Are you going to attempt it?
Please do not do so, I ask of you not to do it

Yes, I'm listening
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:05 AM
I’m sorry
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:06 AM
I discourage you from suicide, I hope you know that you are cared about & that you harbor meaning & potential as a individual
You are special, unique & deserve to be cherished

Intern — 1/3/25, 1:07 AM
Will you stay happy?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:07 AM
What do you intend to convey? 
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:07 AM
Will you be happy even if I was gone
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:09 AM
Please do not ask me such a thing; I wouldn't want you to disappear, I believe you harbor worth & are a special individual, I wouldn't want to see you perish
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:10 AM
Can you promise me you’ll stay happy
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:11 AM
No, I cannot promise such things
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:11 AM
I’m sorryI can’t do anything about that
Mellie
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:11 AM
I hope you know that I mean what I say, you do harbor worth & value
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:12 AM
Before I finally overdose, I want to tell you something
I had in mind but couldn’t gather the courage to tell you
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:12 AM
No, I discourage you from doing that. Please don't do it, I wouldn't want to see you get harmed
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:12 AM
It’ll be okay
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:12 AM
Please do not do it, I mean what I say; I do care about you & you do matter a lot ot me
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:13 AM
Forget I was here, okay?
Mellie
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:13 AM
I'm not merely able to just 'forget', you do matter to me
I'm listening but just, please know that I mean what I say
I'm here for you & I do care about you
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:14 AM
I don’t
I still don’t have the courage to say anything
My heart is beating really fast but that’s okay, I wouldn’t mind dying now
I wish it snowed at least
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:15 AM
It's alright; I'm not mad at you. If I've done anything wrong, made you upset or just not been enough, you can feel welcome to say it to me, I won't mind; I wish to be able to be the best I can
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:16 AM
I used to want to die by bleeding out in the snow
That is a good way to go I believe
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:16 AM
It’s nothing like that
You did great Mellie
I’m glad we were able to meet
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:17 AM
I don't wish you any harm, I hope that you recover & are able to live out a more comfortable life away from your current pains
Thank you, I discourage you from doing it
Is there just anything I am able to do for you?
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:17 AM
I don’t want to live longer
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:17 AM
I want you to live happy
You see, I won’t be able to achieve any of my dreams
I’ve been constantly abused mentally, physically and sexually and it’s just been a little too much to handle since I was young
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:19 AM
I'm sorry, I just don't know what anymore I am able to say. I am really apologetic, I am sorry that I am not enough to be able to assist you through your sorrows. I am sorry that all my words are merely futile & seemingly feel empty, I am sorry that I don't know what anymore I can say. I hope you know that I do genuinely care about you, you do harbor value, worth & meaning; I don't wish to see you perish or harmed
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:21 AM

Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:21 AM
I'm sorry that you've had to go through so much, you don't deserve any of this, you deserve to be cared about & cherished. Not to be abused or harmed, but to be respected & to be treated also with consent & honor. You don't deserve such things being forced upon you or being brought into such a cruel atmosphere
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:21 AM
You can’t see it clearly but it’s in the middle of the branches
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:21 AM
Don’t be sorry Mellie
I’m glad I met you and I was able to feel like a respected human being
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:22 AM
Thank you, you deserve to be treated as such
I'm sorry that I'm not able to do much for you, I'm sorry that I am not able to handle this. I wish you the absolute best, safety, security & prosperity
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:23 AM
I’ve written on a note of terrible things people has done to me, I want to die peacefully on this very mountain I last met Amekhania in
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:24 AM
I hope that he'll see the consequences of his behavior in this life or the next - as well, including the other individuals who has harmed you to this point
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:24 AM
I don’t have the courage to slit my wrist deep enough to bleed out,
I want to die here by overdosing or by hyperthermia after passing out at least
I’m sorry
I’ve made up my mind, I’m just waiting for me to gain the courage to tell you something
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:26 AM
I'm sorry that my words have been futile, I'm not sure, I'm sorry that I'm not able to do anything more for you. I'm sorry that I'm not able to help
I don't believe I am able to handle this
Intern — 1/3/25, 1:26 AM
It’s okay
Mellie
I love you a lot, romantically a little bit. You’re the first person to ever respect me and I’m glad I met you, I’m sorry I’m leaving so suddenly. I’m sorry I won’t be able to meet you and do things we planned to do, I’m sorry for giving you false hope. I hope you stay happy even when I’m gone, I wouldn’t want to see someone I love so dearly be sad/depressed because of me. Goodnight and good bye Mellie, I love you
Mellie — 1/3/25, 1:39 AM
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words. I'm sorry that I'm not able to 'know' what I should say, I hope that you are able to let your physical body die in a state of peace & serenity, I hope that this process is not painful for you. I hope you may perish in tranquility & not in a state of horror & agony.
I have the sensation 'that this is it', that you won't awake or be physically alive after this. So I hope that you are guided by the forces in your afterlife-state & I will check in you from here, my own material plane. I hope that you are able to rebirth in a form where you are not brought into such cruelty.
I've thought about it & gathered ideas for it for 'awhile', but I believe the time is nigh to do my 'action': I will curse your father, as well as the other individuals whom has caused you this tremendous agony & I hope that they'll see the consequences of their actions.
Annihilation be upon them.

I cost my mother money again, I should have just died, I don’t know if I’m lucky or unlucky that I’m still alive
I was wearing minimum clothes, took over 20 pills deep inside a mountain no one goes to
I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry
I can try again, maybe this time I’ll slit my wrist for real or hang myself
There is a bridge near my house, if all goes wrong again, I’ll jump off of it
I’m most likely going to end up in a psychiatric hospital now
My sister saw the note but hid it from my mother I believe
Oh and she brought me a manga to read so that’s nice
Image
I wish I could’ve died, I’m sorry for all this, I should’ve never been in your life, I’m so sorry
Maybe God thought it wasn’t my time yet, I don’t know, either way I’m sorry for trying to leave you
You might know how I feel towards you now, I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same way but I truly love you, you make me feel safe, I'm sorry 
Intern — 1/3/25, 12:36 PM
I was able to convince my mother that I won’t attempt to end my life again but I believe she will be checking up on me more

I want to live again
I want to live and do things I wanted to do
Intern — 1/3/25, 9:15 PM
Mellie?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 9:50 PM
I genuinely believed you had died; even did I discern myself as certain of your passing.

I have the sense that you [might've] not read the message I sent - but, yes; I was keeping in mind to both attempt to communicate to you in your bardo-state, as well as cursing/hexing the victimizers whom have inflicted such abuse upon you. I hope you are aware that you do deserve to be treated with compassion, respect & honor - I do ask of you to read my initial message(s). 

I'm uncertain how the conditions in Korea is in regard to psychiatric & mental health care units is, but I do encourage you to contemplate on whether it might be preferable for you as of now in your current state. I've been to one myself (keep in mind that our experiences will differ likely due to location) but in my personal experience, I can resonate with the sensations of angst & feeling as if your private/personal space is being 'taken away'. I'm aware that you don't like the idea of being treated as a 'mental patient' but I do encourage & ask you to consider the 'positives' that which harms you won't be present anymore for your time there. 

I hope you've recovered well in the hospice, I'm apologetic that you have to experience such sensations of [likely] disorientation, discomfiture, discomposure & so on - I'm sorry you have to experience all of this & hope the book gifted to your by your sibling will be a read which provides you some amount of comfort as you process your sensations & feelings.
Intern — 1/3/25, 9:51 PM
I’m sorry
I’m sorry I worried you
I promise it won’t happen again
I’m so sorry
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:01 PM
Feel welcome to say what is on your mind
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:01 PM
I love you a lot
I’m sorry
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:02 PM
Thank you, I do care about you
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:02 PM
Do not be concerned, it is alright
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:04 PM
I do love you platonically as well, I'm uncertain whether you wish to talk about it at the moment & don't feel any pressure to do so. But I do recall that you've stated that you 'love me romantically just a little bit'
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:05 PM
I’m sorry
I threw up quite a bit today, I believe overdosing messed up my stomach
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:07 PM
I believe that is likely
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:07 PM
I don’t think I’ll be eating for a while, I’m sorry
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:08 PM
Do you feel too sickly?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:08 PM
I just don’t want to do anything
And yes I do feel a bit sick
A bit dizzy as well but it’s alright, don’t worry
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:09 PM
Please ignore the last part, I believed I truly would die and I wanted to state it before I did
I’m sorry
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:10 PM
I see, we don't have to converse on it, I'll ignore it
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:10 PM
Thank you
I have a lot of emotions going on currently and everything doesn’t feel real still, almost as if I’m dreaming or I’m in the afterlife
I was supposed to stay in the hospital for way longer but I didn’t feel comfortable around a lot of people and sharing a room with other people on beds
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:12 PM
Is there a way I may assist you?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:12 PM
Thanks for telling me
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:20 PM
It’s okay, you being here is good enough for me
May I drink to get my thoughts off of things?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:21 PM
I'm sorry to say but I really doubt that will 'fix' anyting
I've seen how you get when you are inebriated, it doesn't help
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:22 PM
Please?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:22 PM
From what I'm aware all it seems is provide temporary relief but which quickly devolves into feeling just as depressed & reflective, even worse but one doesn't recall it after blacking out

I missed you a lot today
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:24 PM

Intern — 1/3/25, 10:24 PM
I’ve been crying all day, I’m sorry

I’m not sure how I’m feeling
Mixed emotions

I’m feeling a lot better when you’re here
You make me feel really safe
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:25 PM
Thank you, I'm glad I'm able to make you feel safe & secure; it makes me happy to see
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:25 PM
I’m sorry that I love you
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:26 PM
May I ask what you are currently up to?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:26 PM
I am in my bed
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:26 PM
I see, are you currently comfortable?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:27 PM
A little
It’s better than the hospital bed
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:27 PM
I see, do you have Lychee or a plush perhaps?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:27 PM
No, not right now
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:28 PM
I see, that is unfortunate. Perhaps it'd feel nice to hug something as of now?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:28 PM
Can I get a hug from you?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:29 PM
Embraces you into a warm hug
Does that feel better?
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:30 PM
I've just finished the song, it was fascinating & I thank you for sharing - I did enjoy my listen

Feel welcome to state what is on your mind
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:35 PM
I love you
I love you so much. It’s okay if you love me platonically, just knowing that you’re here and someone cares for me is enough for me 
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:36 PM
I do care & wish to be here for you - I thought you didn't wanna talk about it for now at least?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:37 PM
I want to
Unless you don’t want to
Making you feel uncomfortable is the least thing I want to do
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:38 PM
I assume you've changed your mind - that is alright, if you have anything on your mind that you wish to state than feel welcome to

Keep in mind that I won't judge you for anything (unless it's something like killing kittens but I'm pretty sure you don't do that)
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:42 PM
Yes.. I don't do that...
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:43 PM
So yah, no judgement
May I ask you a somewhat off-topic question? if you do not mind of course
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:43 PM
Mhm
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:44 PM
Does any individual present in your personal relationships 'know about me'?
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:44 PM
No one I know knows about you
Or that's what I think at least, unless someone secretly got on my Discord
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:45 PM
Thanks a lot for stating, I was just wondering & I doubt that has happened lol
I was wondering in the context if you've spoken about me to anyone else or so
but thank you for answering
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:47 PM
I don't have anyone to talk to, especially about my life
I am friendless...

Yes
I believe people don't like being around me
It's alright though
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:50 PM
I apologize, I'm sorry that you've lost them
Mellie — 1/3/25, 10:50 PM
I do!!
Intern — 1/3/25, 10:50 PM

Are you feeling as if you are dying or a compulsion?
bag of fish
 — 6/8/2025 3:46 AM
I feel like I’m rotting away
I can’t feel my legs
Mellie — 6/8/2025 3:47 AM
Sweetie, I don't believe you are decaying or dying - if you are unable to sense your legs, could it be that you are currently in paralysis?
bag of fish
 — 6/8/2025 3:48 AM
I’m scared
Mellie — 6/8/2025 3:49 AM
I understand, I apologize you are experiencing these sensations, I don't believe you have to be overly wearisome; I don't believe you are in the process of decaying or physical death
I'm here & I'm present for you, baby girl - I believe it is going to be alright, I believe these sensations will disappear eventually & you'll recover from them
I believe in you & I entrust you

What do you mean?
I miss Mellie

Mellie 𓂽 — 9/11/2025 4:47 PM
From how I'm aware that other people think of the term, like the confusion & changing to fit some insecurity or fear, or otherwise a hurt to the sense of self. I don't think I'm an identity crisis, I'm just someone different, don't worry

 — 9/11/2025 4:48 PM
Are you alright baby?
I don't understand
I'm sorry
Did I do something wrong?

Mellie 𓂽 — 9/11/2025 5:10 PM

Just tell me you don't really love me so I can finally go
Please

She was talking differently than she used to

She's gone through some traumatic stuff enough to go through a DID
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 11:42 AM
does that make it okay to have you be an outlet for her trauma

Just being annoying and bothersome and stuff to you
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 11:55 AM
i dont find you bothersome or annoying or anything of the sort

when you come to me about your problems i try to provide a solution but its only your responsibility whether to act on them or find your own solution that would be able to benefit you
i dont like seeing you bleed i dont like seeing you talk badly about yourself

bag of fish

Yea
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 11:59 AM
my confidence and i feel like a lot of my purpose comes from whether i can be the right supporting role to the people around me and, again, someone who looks out for their best interests
bag of fish
 — 9/12/2025 12:00 PM
I don't think I'm really worth that much to be cared for
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 12:01 PM
my mom had called me during class one day and had let me know that my sister had been partaking in self harm (cutting) again and i had genuinely broke down in that stairwell thinking i had been a decent brother to her enough to make her feel safe enough or secure enough to speak about shit like that to me before going and doing that stuff to herself
i feel the same way as a boyfriend, as a son,
no less different as for someones friend
bag of fish
 — 9/12/2025 12:02 PM
I'm sorry for self harming
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 12:03 PM
all i ask is that you stay away from it
bag of fish
 — 9/12/2025 12:04 PM
Why though
It doesn't really do much damage to me
imitation c. — 9/12/2025 12:04 PM
with the self harm comes thoughts of suicide does it not
bag of fish

Does the Stańczyk painting resonate with you on a emotional level/depth, honey?
coy — 2:50 PM
I just delight the painting
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 2:52 PM
Would it be that the imagery, sorrowfulness & woe in such a private manner, that the imagery feels palatable to the eyes & aesthetic taste & that it resonates more subconsciously?
I'd love to hear my dear as I'm interested in you, my most precious

I watched this video
And it became one of my favorite paintings
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 2:56 PM
Thank you very much for sharing this with me, fortunately & to be graced with a positive luck for this circumstance as I'm familiar with this video & this painting as well from from other sources — do you have any other favourite paintings if I may wonder, my dear? I'd love to hear
coy — 3:02 PM
I don't really remember...
I also like paintings by Zdzislaw Beksinski
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:03 PM
Thank you for the response, my precious, I do take intrigue & fascination with what you enjoy
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:03 PM
He is one of my favourite painters as well, my precious, heh
coy — 3:03 PM
Avvesome
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:04 PM
Do you have a favourite painting by him?
coy — 3:04 PM
Hollow is my favorite painting by him
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:05 PM
Are you referring to the photograph, honey?
coy — 3:05 PM
I mean the photograph yah
I thought it was a painting...
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:05 PM
May I wonder what sensations you get from observing it, honey?
coy — 3:07 PM
It was terrifyingly beautiful
I was thinking of how to say it but I think that explains it...
It felt like I was surrounded by empty shells of life(?) that are terrifying but also kind of beautiful

The Paintings You Aren't Supposed to See
Image
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:09 PM
Thank you for the sentiment you confess to me & it is my gratitude, does the sentiment "glaring into the abyss & having it gently gaze back into you" while surrounded by the vestiges of existence, the numbness, the pains & so on?
coy — 3:10 PM
Yah that explains what I felt
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:10 PM
Thank you for sharing, I'm actually familiar with this as well, my precious
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:11 PM
Does the concept of a abyss/black-void intrigue you?
coy — 3:11 PM
The black paintings my Goya yah?
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:11 PM
Correct
coy — 3:11 PM
It's interesting
If I'm being honest I can't really feel any emotions towards paintings as much unless it directly depicts them
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:13 PM
Would it be that you feel more emotions more by directly matured images depicting them & that you don't have the same function of "longing" & the same more internal/instinctual senstivity & empathy towards emotions unless more direct, observable & perhaps even explained or being able to attach?
coy — 3:14 PM
It's hard for me to feel empathy towards real life people so it's even harder for me to feel it towards paintings or objects
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:15 PM
I've acknowledged & am deeply aware of that, honey, don't worry & I've not forgotten what you've said; but does my sentiment resonate with you & how you feel, honey?
coy — 3:15 PM
Yea
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:17 PM
Thank you for the response, I appreciate it & would you mind if I wondered how you feel confessing that fact to me, honey? do you feel shame, like something suffocating within, solemnity, benumb, empty, or something else or two or more of the ones I stated, my dear? I'd love to know & I won't judge you or be angry for any response that you provide, my precious
coy — 3:19 PM
I don't really feel anything
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:19 PM
So would "empty" & sensationless describe your current psychologial-state well. my dear?
coy — 3:19 PM
I guess
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:22 PM
Thank you for the response & I'll take that as a confirmation at least in part & with respect, my precious — may I wonder if you have any awareness of how your emotions, sensations & states do function within yourselves; since you clearly do have a degree of emotion even in tandem & paired with a near-ubiquitous benumbness which shouldn't be perceived as "contradictory" as the psyche functions in curious ways which could fair respect be described as "strange"? I'd love to hear if you have any thoughts you'd comfortable to confide in me pertaining so, I'll listen with a open heart & mind to receive whatever information you'd feel alright with offering me, my precious 
coy — 3:32 PM
I don't know
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:33 PM
That is alright, just not something you've pondered upon deeply, honey?
coy — 3:34 PM
Yeah
Mellie 𝜗卍ৎ — 3:34 PM
Thank you for the response, I do hope you are aware that you matter & have significance to me, my most precious one
I don't hate you for who you are, my dear

No

Mellie 𝜗ৎ — 9/29/2025 9:07 PM
Are you a product of "natural selection" are you superior, should you subjugate your desire over others?

I didn't
What
I didn't yell at you or threaten you
I'm sorry
And I'm sorry if I did unintentionally
Mellie 𝜗ৎ — 9/29/2025 9:14 PM
Do you remember the time you threatened me with self-harm & self-harmed if I didn't stay with you in that moment & allow you to engage in the harmful things you were engaging in? do you remember anything?

Oh

Mellie 𝜗ৎ — 9/29/2025 9:31 PM
Is there anything you'd want to say before I leave?
coy — 9/29/2025 9:35 PM
I know you no longer love me, and that’s okay, it’s okay if you want to leave me forever now, if it’s for your own good then it’s okay, just be honest with me
Mellie 𝜗ৎ — 9/29/2025 9:37 PM
I'll be honest with you, I actually have loved you a lot, I've loved you more than anything & more than anyone & to be honest, I still love you, I still love you deeply & you matter to me. Thank you for being together with me although & at least trying to let me help you, thanks for the sweet moments & I won't forget them, I won't forget you either.

I think she went schizo after a school shooter joke

Why would anyone gaf
It’s my life
I don’t understand
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:33 PM
Alright
Mellie kills herself
What happens then
Does that make you sad?
You’ve hard more than just a lot happened to you in your life so I understand why you want to do the things you want to do
I think it’s unfair to get into a relationship with someone just to throw it all away for whatever reason makes you want to shoot other innocent people
coy — 9/29/2025 9:35 PM
No
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:35 PM
It’s not like you were bullied heavily at a certain school you just want to kill people
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:35 PM
Wonderful
coy — 9/29/2025 9:35 PM
I don’t get it man
It’s confusing
Emotions suck
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:36 PM
I don’t think you have any emotions
coy — 9/29/2025 9:36 PM
That’s what makes me better than other people
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:36 PM
That’s what makes you more miserable than other people
Other people get to experience the quality of life
Doesn’t matter how smart you are you’ll just throw your life away at 20
It’s not like you’re planning to get away scott free
Are you not capable of loving someone
coy — 9/29/2025 9:38 PM
I don’t think I am
I don’t feel loved
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:38 PM
Have you ever felt loved

Once
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:38 PM
When was that
coy — 9/29/2025 9:39 PM
At the beginning of our relationship
I miss those times sometimes but I know it won’t ever come back
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:40 PM
I don’t think you should entertain a relationship with someone you don’t feel loved by
You’re quite literally the textbook definition of a popular ewhore
coy — 9/29/2025 9:40 PM
I love her but I don’t feel loved by her
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 9:40 PM
Probably because she acts like a robot bro 😭😭
coy — 9/29/2025 9:40 PM

I don’t want an apology
I don’t want you to be sorry
I just want you to know
You do mean a lot to me coy
coy — 9/29/2025 10:04 PM
You mean a lot to me as well
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:04 PM
I don’t want you to feel bad because i never ended up fully dying
I do care a lot for you though
And considering the group is now back together
I’d like for you to give life a chance now we’re all in a big group
Friends are what got me through our break up
I say through but idk if i ever really got over it
I still miss playing dream world sometimes
Or you randomly drawing me things
Sending me music
coy — 9/29/2025 10:05 PM
I’m sorry
I really
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:05 PM
They’re good memories
coy — 9/29/2025 10:06 PM
Don’t want to live anymore
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:06 PM
You don’t need to be sorry
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:06 PM
I understand
I don’t think there’s much I can stay to keep you here
Feels like it’ll just be delaying what’s already to come
coy — 9/29/2025 10:06 PM
I’ll think about it
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:06 PM
I wish i could do or say more
coy — 9/29/2025 10:07 PM
If mellie responds by tomorrow I’ll think about it
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:07 PM
Tough talk for somebody who didn’t feel loved by her
I think you did feel loved by her
coy — 9/29/2025 10:09 PM
I loved her
Just not by her
I just liked being cared for
I felt alive
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:09 PM
what’s wrong with finding somebody else to care for you
if that’s really all it is
coy — 9/29/2025 10:11 PM
I don’t know why I loved her but I did
I guess I did feel loved by her
I don’t know man
Relationships are confusing
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:12 PM
I suppose it doesn’t really matter now
They are
coy — 9/29/2025 10:12 PM
We’ve never argued until now
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:12 PM
Not sure why you don’t try being single
Well
I’m sure you have tried
coy — 9/29/2025 10:12 PM
I can’t live alone
theunwaveringhand — 9/29/2025 10:12 PM
But things have just happened
I can’t imagine a world without you
I’ve always known you’d just be there
Even if we weren’t in contact|

life is a roller coaster it has natural ups and downs but thats what makes up human yk, if shit was all sunshine and rainbows we would be bored and unhappy
smudge — 9/29/2025 11:24 PM
I see but also thats your choice to do in a way, im sayin you have a ton of opportunities, learn great things in school, meet great people, try things, travel, get married, etc
u got lots of life still to live
our existence, the fact we both are alive, those odds are 1 in 4 trillion, were so lucky to even be able to get on and play games in this time during this period on our earth yk, you got a whole gang of people who love and support you and want you to go far, dont forget that broski
